Choosing a research advisor...
------
### ... means choosing a research group and topic simultaneously. We will handle the three choices separately. 

## First, some background:
### I am a first-year graduate student. It is January. By March, I will commit my labor to one advisor, one research group, and one area of expertise. Millenial *gamophobia* (fear-of-commitment) aside, this is quite a difficult decision. It sets the trajectory of my career, determines the people I will interact with professionally, and concentrates my efforts into one domain. Advice regarding this decision is seldom specific because the process is unique to each individual. My favorite recent advice: "This is the biggest decision of your graduate career, but really, no pressure." 
### As an aspiring researcher, I like to gather information to make informed decisions. As a closet philosopher, I believe that knowledge defeats fear. Here is the research I've gathered on the topic to help myself and others in a similar position. 

## Research advisor
### 1. Your advisor should be a good researcher. The reason why you *came* to graduate school was to do research, so naturally, you want to work with someone who can guide you towards your goal. How can a fresh, new first-year grad student discern the characteristics of a good researcher? There are some small indicators. A good researcher:
- **Asks important questions.** I have attended meetings in many different groups, and I always note the types of questions that the advisor asks. Good questions expose weaknesses in scientific evidence and pose suggestions for improvement. Other good questions lead to discussions that clarify scientific concepts or interpret data, causing the whole room to go "aha!" 
- **Publishes in good journals.** This increases the researcher's credibility and visibility in the field. I have a set of journals that I've enjoyed reading over my undergrad research experiences, so I'm leaning towards choosing an advisor that publishes in them. This is a tough criterion for newer professors who haven't had the chance to establish their groups. 
- **Gets grants.** This researcher can communicate the value of his/her research, often to people outside the field. He or she can financially support your work. You should strive to learn this skill. 
- **Has a good reputation with other faculty and people in the field.** Have you asked your undergraduate mentors about your potential advisor? 
- **Writes well.** Read the papers of the research group you are considering. Read anything your potential adviser has out for the public. What is the quality of the writing? Here's a cutting quote from *Getting What You Came For* by Robert Peters, Ph.D, that illustrates the point: "If you are so unlucky as to find yourself laboring to fulfill the stylistic and structural demands of a literary dunce, who may destroy the writing you have labored over, you will become a candidate for therapy." 

### All this to say, faculty who are more advanced in their career may have a leg-up in the above criteria. Do not shy away from a young faculty member who can alot time for your scientific and professional development. Younger faculty tend to be up-to-date in the latest lab techniques, which leads to fruitful mentorship opportunities. In fact, young faculty members tend to excel in the next criterion: 

### 2. Your advisor should be a good mentor. Professor Ben Barres in ["How to Pick a Graduate Advisor"](https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0896627313009070f) proposes an M-index to measure "mentoring quality" -- off-setting the "H-index" of "research quality." This is to say that mentoring quality is just as important as publication quality but is often overlooked. Some resources ([here](https://www-sciencemag-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/careers/2019/04/what-matters-phd-adviser-here-s-what-research-says)) say that this is the *most* important factor in choosing an adviser. A good mentor:
- **Is around.** If you find yourself near the advisor's office, do you tend to see him or her? Some advisors can actually go *weeks* missing. It was funny for me to experience different research groups because the students would consider their respective advisor to be "hands-off", but in my perspective, the advisors were hands-off on different levels. For one group, I actually went weeks without seeing the advisor, while for the other group, the advisor would have two meetings a week, email the group regularly with internship/scholarship/conference opportunities, but maybe not concern himself with the technical details of 25 different research projects. The second advisor was hands-off research-wise but still actively advocating for the students. 
- **Supports students on the job-hunt.** Where do students end up after they graduate? I tend to favor a healthy balance of academia and industry. It indicates that students can pursue their own career interests while receiving support from the faculty member. Most importantly, *the alumni get jobs.*
- **Typically has students who graduate on time.** This time-span varies for different fields. Research other groups in the same field for a fair comparison. 
- **Gives consistent feedback and goals.** Advisors are busy people, and sometimes they forget what they say. Aim for consistent feedback *most of the time*. If emotions get involved, however, then it's game-over for your happiness and growth. If your advisor often flips between angry and pleased with your project, you may experience a lot of stress and insecurity.  
- **Has the respect of the group members.** Talk to the students in the group that you're joining. No advisor (or student for that matter) is perfect, but talking to members will expose characteristics that you either appreciate or want to avoid. 
- **Establishes rapport with you.** You should be able to be open and talk to your advisor about topics even beyond the science. You should not be afraid of your advisor, but you should maintain a close respect for him or her. 

### 3. Hands-on vs. hands-off questions to consider: 
- Do you like constant, direct feedback? 
- Do you tend to have your own direction?
- How often do you want to meet with your advisor? 

## Research group
### 1. You will become "like" your research group. Your senior graduate students will train you on lab equipment. They will likely proofread your fellowship applications and papers. You will watch their presentations, and they will evaluate your first presentations. For this reason, you want group members who are productive. Productive group members:
- **Publish well.** They can give you tips on what it takes to start writing papers. They can provide solidarity over tough reviewers. They form a strong network to fall back on. You can trust them to do experiments if you need their field of expertise.
- **Seek opportunities.** See if they pursue internships in industry, fellowships, or professional development programs. You'll see that similar opportunities could be possible for you. 
### 2. More importantly than productive, you want to join a group that is internally healthy. Group members demonstrate healthy dynamics when they: 
- **Engage in collaborative projects within and outside the group.** Again, look for a healthy balance. I recently heard a snippet about another group whose members *only want to collaborate outside the group* because they are afraid that their own lab members will steal their work. Alert! 
- **Choose to hang out outside of work.** This is a great sign--apparently the group members can't get enough of each other!
- **Have outside interests** This is a sign of group members' independence. They can set their own schedule, get things done in lab, and hone another highly-valued skill or hobby. 
### 3. Questions to consider: 
- Are there diverse backgrounds to work with?
- How big is the group? 
- How does the group operate? 
- Is there a power hierarchy or is it more collaborative?
- How is it broken down into groups and areas of expertise? What would be your area of expertise? 

## Research topic
### 1. You want a research topic that interests you. Okay, work becomes work, and by year three, no matter what you choose, it might start to get stale. Everyone experiences this a bit differently. But the initial excitement about the topic sparks the motivation to learn the field and get experiments underway, so make sure you *love* your initial topic and project. These should interest you by:
- **Addressing a bigger problem or fundamental question that excites you.** What motivates you to be a scientist? What have you been curious about? You can choose a problem to solve or you can investigate a phenomenon: the classic applied/fundamental divide. Most research topics can include both types of studies. 
- **Involving compatible day-to-day responsibilities** If you want to cure cancer but get squeamish at the sight of blood, your research career might not pan out. I typically ask group members what the "most annoying" part of their work is. For making colloidal nanocrystal, it's the irreproducibility of the synthesis after years of working on it. For 2D material scientists, it's maintaing a firm grasp of really thin flakes with tweezers. For computational and theoretical folks, it's sitting down at a computer all day. Know the types of work you will have to do on a daily basis, and make sure it is tolerable to you. 
- **Capturing your focus when reading literature** I have found that I can understand most literature in materials science, but some topics just do not interest me. I can tell by how my attention wanders. The literature that interests me, on the other hand, has me furiously scribbling notes and looking up terms that I do not understand. 
### 2. You want a research topic that will translate to a job. The topic has a higher chance of leading to a job if you find: 
- **Companies, post-docs, or fellowship opportunities that logically follow.** It is never too early to consider what you want to do for a career. 
- **A larger community around the topic** Who are the experts in the field, your role-models, whose work you like to read and propagate? Is it possible to visit their group? Will they speak at your university or attend the same conference as you? Learn from these role-models. Did the students who came before you get jobs? Your community will give you direction to employment after you get your Ph.D.
### 3. Questions to consider:
- What problem do you want to solve?
- Which area of fundamental science interests you?
- Where do you want to be in five years?

###  Decision made? If yes, then congrats! If not, then keep gathering information until you do. Once it's done, you can forget about those other options for advisors/groups/topics. The next step after **The Big Decision** is to forge ahead, learn from your mistakes, and make the best of every situation, knowing that you did the legwork to set-up your future career!

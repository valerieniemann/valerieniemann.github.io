Choosing a research advisor...
------
... means choosing a research group and topic. So we will handle these three simultaneous choices separately. 

### Some background:
#### I am a first-year graduate student. It is January. By March, I need to commit to my labor to one boss, one research group, and one area of expertise. As a millenial I have commitment-phobia. An aspiring researcher, I like to learn about things that I don't know a lot about. So here is the small collection of research I've done regarding the topic, I hope it is helpful to other current/future grad students in the same position.

Choosing a research advisor...
------
... means choosing a research group and topic simultaneously. We will handle the three choices separately. 

### But first, some background:
#### I am a first-year graduate student. It is January. By March, I will commit my labor to one advisor, one research group, and one area of expertise. Millenial *gamophobia* (fear-of-commitment) aside, this is quite a difficult decision. It sets the trajectory of my career, determines the people I will interact with professionally, and concentrates my efforts into one domain. Advice comes in different forms, and it's never too specific, because the process is unique to each individual. My favorite recent advice: "This is the biggest decision of your graduate career, but really, no pressure." 
#### As an aspiring researcher, I like to gather information to make informed decisions. As a closet philosopher, I believe that knowledge defeats fear. Here is the research I've gathered on the topic to help myself and others in a similar position. 

### Research advisor
#### 1. Your advisor should be a good researcher. The reason why you *came* to graduate school was to do research, so naturally, you want to work with someone who can guide you towards your goal. How can a lowly first-year grad student discern the characteristics of a good researcher? There are some small indicators. A good researcher:
- **Asks important questions.** I have attended many group meetings, and I always note the types of questions that the adviser asks. There are advisers that are adept at pointing out weaknesses in evidence to state a claim. They often give suggestions for improvement. Other good questions I've heard have led to discussions to clarify scientific concepts or interpret data, leaving the whole room to go "aha!". 
- **Publishes in good journals.** This isn't an end-all be-all requirement if it's not there--some advisors are just starting out, and they have to start somewhere! It is typically a postive sign, however. I have a set of journals that I've enjoyed reading over my undergrad research experiences, so I'm leaning towards choosing an adviser that publishes in them. 
- **Has been awarded grants.** This researcher can communicate the value of his/her research and support your work. You would do well to learn this skill from him or her. 
- **Has a good reputation with other faculty and people in the field.** Have you asked your undergraduate mentors about your potential adviser? 
- **Must be a good writer.** Read the papers of the research group you are considering. Read anything and everything your potential adviser has out for the world's eyes. What is the quality of the writing? Here's a slighty-harsh quote from *Getting What You Came For* by Robert Peters, Ph.D, that illustrates the point: "If you are so unlucky as to find yourself laboring to fulfill the stylistic and structural demands of a literary dunce, who may destory the writing you have labored over, you will become a candidate for therapy." 
- All this to say, faculty who are more advanced in their career may have a leg-up in the above criteria. Do not shy away from a young faculty member who can alot time for you and understands the latest lab techniques. In fact, young faculty members tend to excel in the next criterion:

### Research group

### Research area 

####  Decision made? If yes, then congrats! If not, then keep gathering information until you do. Once it's done, you can forget about those other options. The next step is to forge full-throttle ahead, learn from your mistakes, and make the best of every situation, knowing that you did the legwork to set-up your future career!

Choosing a research advisor...
------
... means choosing a research group and topic simultaneously. We will handle the three choices separately. 

### But first, some background:
#### I am a first-year graduate student. It is January. By March, I will commit my labor to one advisor, one research group, and one area of expertise. Millenial *gamophobia* (fear-of-commitment) aside, this is quite a difficult decision. It sets the trajectory of my career, determines the people I will interact with professionally, and concentrates my efforts into one domain. Advice regarding this decision is seldom specific because the process is unique to each individual. My favorite recent advice: "This is the biggest decision of your graduate career, but really, no pressure." 
#### As an aspiring researcher, I like to gather information to make informed decisions. As a closet philosopher, I believe that knowledge defeats fear. Here is the research I've gathered on the topic to help myself and others in a similar position. 

### Research advisor
#### 1. Your advisor should be a good researcher. The reason why you *came* to graduate school was to do research, so naturally, you want to work with someone who can guide you towards your goal. How can a fresh, new first-year grad student discern the characteristics of a good researcher? There are some small indicators. A good researcher:
- **Asks important questions.** I have attended many group meetings, and I always note the types of questions that the adviser asks. There are advisers that use great questions to expose weaknesses in scientific evidence, followed by suggestions for improvement. Other good questions I've heard have led to discussions to clarify scientific concepts or interpret data, leaving the whole room to go "aha!" 
- **Publishes in good journals.** This isn't a strict requirement--some advisors are just starting, and they have to start somewhere! It is typically an added bonus. I have a set of journals that I've enjoyed reading over my undergrad research experiences, so I'm leaning towards choosing an adviser that publishes in them. 
- **Gets grants.** This researcher can communicate the value of his/her research, often to people outside the field. He or she can financially support your work. You would do well to learn from these abilities. 
- **Has a good reputation with other faculty and people in the field.** Have you asked your undergraduate mentors about your potential adviser? 
- **Must be a good writer.** Read the papers of the research group you are considering. Read anything and everything your potential adviser has out for the public. What is the quality of the writing? Here's a cutting quote from *Getting What You Came For* by Robert Peters, Ph.D, that illustrates the point: "If you are so unlucky as to find yourself laboring to fulfill the stylistic and structural demands of a literary dunce, who may destroy the writing you have labored over, you will become a candidate for therapy." 
- All this to say, faculty who are more advanced in their career may have a leg-up in the above criteria. Do not shy away from a young faculty member who can alot time for you and understands the latest lab techniques. In fact, young faculty members tend to excel in the next criterion: 
#### 2. Your advisor should be a good mentor. Professor Ben Barres in ["How to Pick a Graduate Advisor"](https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0896627313009070f) proposes an M-index to measure "mentoring quality" -- off-setting the "H-index" of "research quality." This is to say that mentoring quality is just as important as publication quality but is often overlooked. Some resources ([here])(https://www-sciencemag-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/careers/2019/04/what-matters-phd-adviser-here-s-what-research-says) say that this is the *most* important factor in choosing an adviser. A good mentor:
- **Is around.** If you find yourself near the adviser's office, do you tend to see him or her? Some advisers can actually go *weeks* missing. It was funny for me to experience different research groups because the students would consider their respective adviser to be "hands-off", but in my mind, they were hands-off on different levels. For one group, I actually went weeks without seeing the adviser, while for the other group, the advisor would have two meetings a week, email the group regularly with internship/scholarship/conference opportunities, but maybe not concern himself with the technical details of 25 different research projects. The second adviser was hands-off research-wise but still actively advocating for the students. 
- **Support students on the job-hunt.** Where do students end up after they graduate? I tend to favor a healthy balance of academia and industry. It indicates that students can pursue their own career interests while receiving support from the faculty member. 
- **Typically has students who graduate on time.** This time-span varies for different fields. Research other groups in the same field for a fair comparison. 
- **Gives consistent feedback and goals.** Advisers are busy people, and sometimes they forget what they say. If emotions get involved, then it's game-over for your happiness and growth. If your adviser often flips how he or she feels about your project, you may experience a lot of stress and insecurity.  
- **Has the respect of the group members.** Talk to the students in the group that you're joining. No advisor (or student for that matter) is perfect, but talking to members will expose characteristics that you either appreciate or want to shy away from. 
- **Connects with you through good rapport.** You should be able to be open and talk to your adviser about topics even beyond the science. You should not be afraid of your adviser, but you should maintain a close respect for him or her. 


### Research group

### Research area 

####  Decision made? If yes, then congrats! If not, then keep gathering information until you do. Once it's done, you can forget about those other options. The next step after the decision is to forge ahead, learn from your mistakes, and make the best of every situation,  while knowing that you did the legwork to set-up your future career!

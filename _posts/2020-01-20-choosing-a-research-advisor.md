Choosing a research advisor...
------
... means choosing a research group and topic. We will handle the three simultaneous choices separately. But first,

### some background:
#### I am a first-year graduate student. It is January. By March, I will commit my labor to one advisor, one research group, and one area of expertise. Millenial *gamophobia* (fear-of-commitment) aside, this is quite a difficult decision. It sets the trajectory of my career, determines the people I will interact with professionally, and concentrates my efforts into one domain. Advice comes in different forms, and it's never too specific, because the process is unique to each individual. My favorite recent advice: "This is the biggest decision of your graduate career, but really, you shouldn't stress about it" 
#### As an aspiring researcher, I like to gather information to make informed decisions. As a closet philosopher, I believe that knowledge defeats fear. Here is the research I've gathered on the topic to help myself and others in a similar position. May it help you make the most informed decision. 

### Research advisor

### Research group

### Research area 

####  Decision made? If yes, then congrats! If not, then keep gathering information until you do. Once it's done, you can forget about those other options. The next step is to forge full-throttle ahead, learn from your mistakes, and make the best of every situation, knowing that you did the legwork to best set-up your future career!

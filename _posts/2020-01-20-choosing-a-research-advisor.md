Choosing a research advisor...
------
... means choosing a research group and topic simultaneously. We will handle the three choices separately. 

### But first, some background:
#### I am a first-year graduate student. It is January. By March, I will commit my labor to one advisor, one research group, and one area of expertise. Millenial *gamophobia* (fear-of-commitment) aside, this is quite a difficult decision. It sets the trajectory of my career, determines the people I will interact with professionally, and concentrates my efforts into one domain. Advice regarding this decision is seldom specific because the process is unique to each individual. My favorite recent advice: "This is the biggest decision of your graduate career, but really, no pressure." 
#### As an aspiring researcher, I like to gather information to make informed decisions. As a closet philosopher, I believe that knowledge defeats fear. Here is the research I've gathered on the topic to help myself and others in a similar position. 

### Research advisor
#### 1. Your advisor should be a good researcher. The reason why you *came* to graduate school was to do research, so naturally, you want to work with someone who can guide you towards your goal. How can a fresh, new first-year grad student discern the characteristics of a good researcher? There are some small indicators. A good researcher:
- **Asks important questions.** I have attended many group meetings, and I always note the types of questions that the advisor asks. There are advisors that use great questions to expose weaknesses in scientific evidence, followed by suggestions for improvement. Other good questions I've heard have led to discussions to clarify scientific concepts or interpret data, leaving the whole room to go "aha!" 
- **Publishes in good journals.** This isn't a strict requirement--some advisors are just starting, and they have to start somewhere! It is typically an added bonus. I have a set of journals that I've enjoyed reading over my undergrad research experiences, so I'm leaning towards choosing an advisor that publishes in them. 
- **Gets grants.** This researcher can communicate the value of his/her research, often to people outside the field. He or she can financially support your work. You should strive to learn this skill. 
- **Has a good reputation with other faculty and people in the field.** Have you asked your undergraduate mentors about your potential advisor? 
- **Must be a good writer.** Read the papers of the research group you are considering. Read anything your potential adviser has out for the public. What is the quality of the writing? Here's a cutting quote from *Getting What You Came For* by Robert Peters, Ph.D, that illustrates the point: "If you are so unlucky as to find yourself laboring to fulfill the stylistic and structural demands of a literary dunce, who may destroy the writing you have labored over, you will become a candidate for therapy." 
- All this to say, faculty who are more advanced in their career may have a leg-up in the above criteria. Do not shy away from a young faculty member who can alot time for you and understands the latest lab techniques. In fact, young faculty members tend to excel in the next criterion: 
#### 2. Your advisor should be a good mentor. Professor Ben Barres in ["How to Pick a Graduate Advisor"](https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0896627313009070f) proposes an M-index to measure "mentoring quality" -- off-setting the "H-index" of "research quality." This is to say that mentoring quality is just as important as publication quality but is often overlooked. Some resources ([here](https://www-sciencemag-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/careers/2019/04/what-matters-phd-adviser-here-s-what-research-says)) say that this is the *most* important factor in choosing an adviser. A good mentor:
- **Is around.** If you find yourself near the advisor's office, do you tend to see him or her? Some advisors can actually go *weeks* missing. It was funny for me to experience different research groups because the students would consider their respective advisor to be "hands-off", but in my perspective, they were hands-off on different levels. For one group, I actually went weeks without seeing the advisor, while for the other group, the advisor would have two meetings a week, email the group regularly with internship/scholarship/conference opportunities, but maybe not concern himself with the technical details of 25 different research projects. The second advisor was hands-off research-wise but still actively advocating for the students. 
- **Supports students on the job-hunt.** Where do students end up after they graduate? I tend to favor a healthy balance of academia and industry. It indicates that students can pursue their own career interests while receiving support from the faculty member. Most importantly, *the alumni get jobs.*
- **Typically has students who graduate on time.** This time-span varies for different fields. Research other groups in the same field for a fair comparison. 
- **Gives consistent feedback and goals.** Advisors are busy people, and sometimes they forget what they say. Aim for consistent feedback most of the time. If emotions get involved, however, then it's game-over for your happiness and growth. If your advisor often flips between angry and pleased with your project, you may experience a lot of stress and insecurity.  
- **Has the respect of the group members.** Talk to the students in the group that you're joining. No advisor (or student for that matter) is perfect, but talking to members will expose characteristics that you either appreciate or want to avoid. 
- **Connects with you through good rapport.** You should be able to be open and talk to your advisor about topics even beyond the science. You should not be afraid of your advisor, but you should maintain a close respect for him or her. 

### Research group
#### 1. You will become "like" your research group. Your senior graduate students will be training you on lab technique. They may proofread your fellowship applications or papers. After you see many of their presentations, they will see many of your presentations and give you their feedback. For this reason, you want group members who are productive. Productive group members:
- **Publish well.** They can give you tips on the types of experiments it took to get ot manuscript stage and how to start writing papers. They can provide solidarity over tough reviewers. They form a strong network to fall back on. You can trust them to do experiments for you if you need their field of expertise (and reverse!)
- **Seek opportunities** Whether it is internships in industry, fellowships, professional development programs, you can compare notes on growing experiences outside of the lab. 
#### 2. More important than outwardly productive, you want to join a group that is internally healthy. Healthy group dynamics can manifest as group members: 
- **Engaging in collaborative projects within and outside the group.** Good work begets good work--internal healthy dynamics often mean other groups are happy to collaborate. 
- **Choosing to hang out outside of work.** This is a great sign--apparently the group members love each other so much that 8 hours isn't enough!
- **Having outside interests** This is a sign of group member independence. He or she can set her own schedule, get things done in lab, and then hone another highly-valued skill or hobby. 

### Research area 
#### 1. Interests you
- **Typical, daily work**
- **Addressing a bigger problem or fundamental question that excites you*
- **You can read the publications in the field without losing interest**
#### 2. Translates well to a job 
- **You've identified companies, post-docs, or fellowship opportunities that are feasible after researching in this area**
- **Has a larger community that you can be a part of--helps if you identify role models in that community whose work you are excited about**

####  Decision made? If yes, then congrats! If not, then keep gathering information until you do. Once it's done, you can forget about those other options. The next step after the decision is to forge ahead, learn from your mistakes, and make the best of every situation,  all while knowing that you did the legwork to set-up your future career!

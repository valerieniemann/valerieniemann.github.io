During the COVID-19 times, I have reflected on what is in my control, made positive lifestyle changes, and collected resources to help me grow. 

Corona has a Silver Lining
------
Let’s start with the numbers. 188,247 people across the states have been tested positive for COVID-19. Over 3,921 people have died – almost quadrupoled from last Thursday. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading government infectious disease expert, warns this number could increase 25-fold to 200,000 deaths. The corresponding grand-total for positive cases would be 2 million—far beyond the capacity of our health-care system.

We are in a crisis. What should we do in the time of crisis? We stay informed, we check our confidence vs knowledge levels, and we identify what is inside our individual control.

This chart portrays some of the responses to these times, especially on the internet: in the headlines, tweets, Facebook posts, and addresses to the nation. The uncertainty elicits various responses. There are people who feel paralyzed with the confirmed-case counts; there are ambitious professionals counting every minute of the commute that they can now put towards their work. There are people, even leaders, in denial. 

I’ve identified with each point on this chart in my knowledge of the coronavirus and how it will impact the future. I find myself rolling back and forth between “There’s more to this than I thought” and “Trust me, it’s complicated.” I’m not overly anxious in my day-to-day life, and I’m not a hyper-productive, hyper-performing human-being. Some days I feel lonely and uncertain. I recognize, however, that social-distancing has afforded me edifying lifestyle changes—and if I can enjoy them, I believe others can too. I will go through these changes in different areas of my life and provide the resources that may help others.

During the COVID-19 times, I have reflected on what is in my control, made positive lifestyle changes, and collected resources to help me grow. 

Corona has a Silver Lining
------
Let’s start with the numbers. 188,247 people across the states have been tested positive for COVID-19. Over 3,921 people have died – almost quadrupoled from last Thursday. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading government infectious disease expert, warns this number could increase 25-fold to 200,000 deaths. The corresponding grand-total for positive cases would be 2 million—far beyond the capacity of our health-care system.

We are in a crisis. What should we do in the time of crisis? We stay informed, we check our confidence vs knowledge levels, and we identify what is inside our individual control.

This chart portrays some of the responses to these times, especially on the internet: in the headlines, tweets, Facebook posts, and addresses to the nation. The uncertainty elicits various responses. There are people who feel paralyzed with the confirmed-case counts; there are ambitious professionals counting every minute of the commute that they can now put towards their work. There are people, even leaders, in denial. 

I’ve identified with each point on this chart in my knowledge of the coronavirus and how it will impact the future. I find myself rolling back and forth between “There’s more to this than I thought” and “Trust me, it’s complicated.” I’m not overly anxious in my day-to-day life, and I’m not a hyper-productive, hyper-performing human-being. Some days I feel lonely and uncertain. I recognize, however, that social-distancing has afforded me edifying lifestyle changes—and if I can enjoy them, I believe others can too.

Understanding what I can control has led me to make positive steps towards well-being in various areas of my life, with help from some online resources, to adapt to the coronavirus situation. My hope is that these resources can help others in this time. 

## Mental Well-being

 I’m fortunate to work in research groups that encourage open mental health discussions.  Last quarter, we invited the mental health professionals at the Stanford Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) to present at our group meeting. They provided resources on how to handle stress and anxiety and prevent procrastination. In the past couple weeks, I have taken a deeper look into the resources they provided. I’ve found the social distancing to be the opportune time to think about stress and put new habits into practice for mental wellness. 
	Apart from taking guidance from these resources, I have been able to understand the conditions for focus and good work. I find that I am most productive first thing in the morning, and after 1-2 PM my productivity wanes. This has been a great time to schedule meetings and “social-distancing walks.” Productivity rises again after dinnertime around 6 or 7 and lasts into the mature evening. Identifying these times of productivity has enabled me to establish a routine—which mitigates my thoughts of “oh I could be doing something better right now, I could be more productive, look at all the productive people on the internet, blah blah.”
	Finally, I have identified a few sharing libraries in my neighborhood, picking up and dropping off some books after a gentle swab with a disinfectant towel. I’ve enjoyed reading—it’s something I’ve sorely missed in the midst of packed terms in grad school.

## Financial Well-being

I am very fortunate in this time to have the financial support of my graduate program. I can rely on regular payments and have enough for the essentials. Meanwhile, social-distancing has removed the temptation of going to cafes. Often, going to a café after working a full day gives me the extra boost to finish an extra piece of work. Or, if there’s a piece of work I’ve been putting off, I find a small walk on a street to a café to be enough mind-clearing preparation before intense concentration on that task. I have, alas, quit this habit and saved tens of dollars per week. My main expense these days is food, and I do not like to frequent the frenzied supermarkets. I shop once per week, thus I keep a tight control of my budget without really trying.

This affords me the ability to do 2 things: 1). I have budgeted a new, <$15 kitchen appliance each week. 2). I can donate extra change to charities. Some of my favorite are the following:

## Physical Well-being
These times encourage prepare every meal. Some of my favorite dishes have been the following: 
- Baked Sweet Potato with Moroccan Lentils https://www.acouplecooks.com/moroccan-sweet-potatoes-with-lemon-tahini-dressing/
- Seared Tilapia with Spiralized Zucchini https://www.womansday.com/food-recipes/food-drinks/recipes/a54833/seared-tilapia-with-spiralized-zucchini-recipe/
-Venezuelan Arepas with Chicken and Avocado https://www.panningtheglobe.com/reina-pepiada-arepas-chicken-avocado/
- Homemade Boba Tea https://healthynibblesandbits.com/how-to-make-bubble-tea/

Palo Alto has been little parks sprinkled throughout the neighborhoods. As you travel in the direction of the Pacific, the sprawling suburbs turn into nature preserves. Every few days, I have been visiting a different preserve by bike and then hiking to views of the Bay and the Pacific Ocean. My goal is to bike to Half-Moon Bay over the next couple weeks. 

In addition, many places are offering online exercise classes. I have taken advantage of free classes at Yogasource and have listed some other places:

## Relational Well-being
It is strange time where everyone, regardless of socio-economic class and age, is doing pretty much the same thing. This means all of my immediate and distant relatives and friends are at their home and plenty available for a call. 
	This goes for my research group as well. I’ve dedicated my personal Zoom meeting ID for working-from-home-together. Checking in with my labmates and chatting in between spans of working, helps develop those relationships in this time. It means a lot to me to be in this together. 
	As mentioned earlier, I have scheduled regular social-distance walks with friends. Plenty of fellow graduate students remain in the area, and I have enjoyed checking in with them, seeing what new stay-at-home hobbies they have acquired, and hearing how they have adjusted their research plans to make the most of these times. In fact, I have even found new parks in Palo Alto in this way. 
	Finally, I am connected to a fabulous “off-campus” housing program. We have come together for activities like assembling flower arrangements with Matilde’s Bloombox, starting a book club with “Bad Blood”, and even cooking together through Zoom. Other friends have started some online Catan games.

## Work Well-being
For work well-being, I’ve established boundaries. I work according to routine hours, and I allow myself plenty breaks. I have allocated a “work-space” that is not in my bedroom. I have inherited a “standing-desk” apparatus, but I have also seen fashion their own out of textbooks or boxes. The daily check-ins with my labmates give us opportunity to check in with each other and share strategies for productivity. My favorite is the “pomodoro method,” which we’ve done while on Zoom. It entails concentrating on a task for 25 minutes, then taking a 5 minute break, and then repeating. 
	I am an experimentalist graduate student without a lab. What this time affords me is many hours to analyze and interpret data, read papers in my field, and think deeply about my project. These times have also brought to my attention the power and versatility of modeling—about to start attempting some calculations to support my research.

## Areas for Improvement
These times aren’t easy. Distraction is real. I spend lots of time on social media and news websites, scrolling through headlines, checking the number of new cases everyday, and looking for the curve to level-off. Yet in writing this, I feel very fortunate for the privileges that I have and the ability to make improvements in my lifestyle. I would like to help the efforts against COVID-19—and I’m open to suggestions for how. 
I will be posting this article to a couple social media sites. Feel free to share how your life has been impacted during this time and positive habits you’ve developed! Have you found ways to contribute to efforts against COVID-19?

During the COVID-19 times, I have reflected on what is in my control, made positive lifestyle changes, and collected resources to help me grow. 

Corona has a Silver Lining
------
Let’s start with the numbers. 188,247 people across the states have been tested positive for COVID-19. Over 3,921 people have died – almost quadrupoled from last Thursday. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading government infectious disease expert, warns this number could increase 25-fold to 200,000 deaths. The corresponding grand-total for positive cases would be 2 million—far beyond the capacity of our health-care system.

We are in a crisis. What should we do in the time of crisis? We stay informed, we check our confidence vs knowledge levels, and we identify what is inside our individual control.

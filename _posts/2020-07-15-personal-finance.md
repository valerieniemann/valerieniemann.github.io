Don't wait any longer to think about personal finances! 

Personal Finance for Graduate Students
------

Any first-year graduate student will tell you that time is a scarce commodity. They might say the same for money. PhD stipends can be meager and do not seem to be enough to save, and certainly not enough to take-on large financial commitments.*

Finishing my first-year classes felt like bringing my head up from underwater, and I could see the rest of the world clearly. As soon as I had time, I could think about money. 

While I had frugal habits - finding free food on campus, cooking large meals for several days, (minus a small coffee and cafe addiction) - I had not thought in-depth about my long-term financial goals. The minute that my friends working professional jobs started talking about their retirement benefits or stock options, I tuned out of the conversation. I thought to myself, "I have never had a substantial, steady income. Why should I learn about finance?" 

A lot of what I have to say finds its root in [PF for PhDs](pfforphds.com) -- Dr. Emily Roberts tells about her own journey saving up for retirement (70K during graduate school!) and other instances where PhD students have pulled off goliathan financial endeavors, such as funding a wedding. What's different about this post is that I am still in the process. 

## Small steps to savings

Personal finance is an area where small steps lead to big results. I had a habit of going to cafes and ordering coffee -- especially during the boredom of working from home during COVID-19. But let's look at the math. Going to Starbucks, for example, just 3x a week, means spending $15 a week. If I do that every week in a year, I've spent $780. In the moment one doesn't think about this. Each separate moment that I'm craving Starbucks or simply a place to walk with a reward seems independent and inconsequential. Cumulatively, they comprise 1/3 of my monthly income after a year. (Side note: this irrational behavior is another justification for the relatively new field of behavioral economics.)
The math is similar for alcohol beverages, which can range $3-$15 per drink. One fancy cocktail per week ends up taking up another 1/3 of my monthly income after a year. Add going out for food once per week, and that's a whole month's income spent on excessive coffee, alcohol, and food. 

Coming to grad school, I had limited the alcoholic beverages and eating-out -- but I had a hard time reducing the coffee intake. My strategy was to delete any apps for cafes, stock my pantry with interesting coffee flavors, and load my fridge with an interesting creamer or two (which together costed around $10 per month instead of $60). Taking this into account but still treating myself occasionally, I can save $640 per year. 

This is how saving works -- it is the small decisions in the daily moments that add up over time.
This is not to say that you should stop going out for coffee, drinks, and food (although you can alway suggest economical alternatives!). It is to say that we should be mindful of the amount and frequency that we spend. By practicing moderation, we can effectively give ourselves a raise in salary. It may seem difficult, but there are practical ways to get started: 

*1.* Look at your bank account online and pay attention to the breakdown of costs. Under what category do you spend the most money? I've known students who did not like to check their bank account, but avoidance will not solve this problem. Find where you spend the most, and take steps to limit the spending.  
##
*2.* Track all of your transactions in your own spreadsheet ([such as this one!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nl-eRuL6yISxyTTURjdU6V54t92MiJBlkQZPuXCLlvg/edit?usp=sharing). This makes you conscious of each amount you spend.  
##
*3.* Delete food/beverage apps that make it too convenient to drop a few bucks.   
##
*4.* Learn how to cook your own meals & meal prep.   
##
*5.* Keep the coupons that come in the mail.   
##
*6.* Ride a bike! This can drastically reduce gas and car maintenance costs (if you have one). It's also better for the environment.   
##
*7.* Suggest "free" activities when hanging out with friends. Go for a walk or hike, have a picnic, or try some online workout videos. What kinds of crafts can you do with what you have? What creative recipes can you make with the food items in your pantry?   
##
*8.* Make sure you *cancel* any *unused subscriptions*. This one gets me all the time. Whether it's a streaming service that you can live without or a site that has a textbook you used for a class, make sure you are not getting billed for a monthly service that you do not use! It is best to keep a running list of your online accounts.  

The small steps we discussed can be made within the confines of your current daily schedule. Already you could be saving over $1000 per year just by selecting a couple of the recommendations and committing to them. Now we will talk about actions that may involve some time and/or risk -- but maybe you're up for it for more saving/spending capacity. 

## Slightly larger steps to savings

We will be talking shortly about reaching financial goals. If you have a specific goal in mind within graduate school (mine is to pay off my undergraduate student loans), then it might be worth investigating ways to earn extra money on the side. If you're just hoping to have more savings or spendings, these suggestions may also be of use to you. 
## 
*1.* Get a side hustle. On campus there are numerous opportunities to earn a little extra money. You do have to decide if your side hustle is worth your precious and finite time. Some rewarding side hustles that could aid in your professional, academic, or research goals include the following:
- Tutoring. Learning how to communicate fundamental conceps is a great skill to hone, and you can develop 
- Mentoring. Perhaps your life experience up to now has been ripe with cool opportunities. Those who are younger than you could learn from your life experience, and perhaps follow similar paths. You can learn mentoring skills and get paid at the same time -- sweet deal!
- Becoming a resident assistant (RA) or a community assistant (CA) for graduate school housing. This usually involves planning fun events for your residents. It does not take up too much time but is well-subsidized. Take advantage of this leadership opportunity that provides a nice bonus on the side!
##
*2* Find an apartment with cheaper rent. Emily Roberts at [PF for PhDs](pfforphds.com) calls this "giving yourself a raise." You do take home more of your stipend at the end of the day. Some graduate students are fortunate to be close to family-- they save a lot of money by living at home. Others, like myself, can find out where cheap(er) housing is after living near campus for a year. I have secured housing for $326 less than my first-year housing -- that's almost $4000 per year in savings! Sometimes you can't control this your first year, but you can take the steps necessary to set yourself up for subsequent years.  
##
*3* Sell what you don't use (anymore). I have a brand-new air-fryer that my grandparents sent me for my birthday. I appreciate the thought, but I have never opened it or used it. It's going onto craigslist! 
##
*4* Apply to additional fellowships/scholarships. This is always an edificial process. I like to say that no matter what your profession, you will need to convince others that what you say has value, and that you are a good investment. While applying to fellowships and scholarships can be a huge time commitment at a smaller success rate, the more you apply to, the easier it gets, and the higher your chances of securing some extra funding.

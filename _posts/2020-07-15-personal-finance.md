Don't wait any longer to think about personal finances! 

Personal Finance for Graduate Students
------

Any first-year graduate student will tell you that time is a scarce commodity. They might say the same for money. PhD stipends can be meager and do not seem to be enough to save, and certainly not enough to take-on large financial commitments.*

Finishing my first-year classes felt like bringing my head up from underwater, and I could see the rest of the world clearly. As soon as I had time, I could think about money. 

While I had frugal habits - finding free food on campus, cooking large meals for several days, (minus a small coffee and cafe addiction) - I had not thought in-depth about my long-term financial goals. The minute that my friends working professional jobs started talking about their retirement benefits or stock options, I tuned out of the conversation. I thought to myself, "I have never had a substantial, steady income. Why should I learn about finance?" 

A lot of what I have to say finds its root in [PF for PhDs](pfforphds.com) -- Dr. Emily Roberts tells about her own journey saving up for retirement (70K during graduate school!) and other instances where PhD students have pulled off goliathan financial endeavors, such as funding a wedding. What's different about this post is that I am still in the process. 

## Small steps to savings

Personal finance is an area where small steps lead to big results. I had a habit of going to cafes and ordering coffee -- especially during the boredom of working from home during COVID-19. But let's look at the math. Going to Starbucks, for example, just 3x a week, means spending $15 a week. If I do that every week in a year, and I've spent $780. In the moment one doesn't think about this. Each separate moment that I'm craving Starbucks or simply a place to walk with a reward seems independent and inconsequential. Cumulatively, they comprise 1/3 of my monthly income. (Side note: this irrational behavior is another justification for the relatively new field of behavioral economics.)
The math is similar for alcohol beverages, which can range $3-$15 per drink. One fancy cocktail per week ends up taking up another 1/3 of my monthly income. Add going out for food once per week, and that's a whole month's income on high-frequencies of coffee, alcohol, and food over the span of a year. 

I had limited the alcoholic beverages and eating-out -- but I had a hard time reducing the coffee intake. My strategy was to delete any apps for cafes, stock my pantry with interesting coffee flavors, and load my fridge with an interesting creamer or two (which together costed around $10 per month instead of $60). Taking this into account but still treating myself occasionally, I can save $640 per year. 

This is how saving works -- it is the small decisions in the daily moments that add up over time.
This is not to say that you should stop going out for coffee, drinks, and food, especially as it kindles friendships. It is to say that we should be mindful of the amount and frequency that we spend. By practicing moderation, we can effectively give ourselves a raise in salary. It may seem difficult, but there are practical ways to get started:

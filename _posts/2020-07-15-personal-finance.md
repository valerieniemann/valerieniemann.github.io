Don't wait any longer to think about personal finances! 

Personal Finance for Graduate Students
------

Any first-year graduate student will tell you that time is a scarce commodity. They might say the same for money. PhD stipends can be meager; the average 30K/year does not seem to be enough to save, and certainly not enough to take-on large financial commitments.*

Finishing my first-year classes felt like bringing my head up from underwater, and I could see the rest of the world clearly again. As soon as I had time, I could think about money. 

While I had frugal habits - finding free food on campus, cooking large meals for several days, (minus a small coffee and cafe addiction) - I had not thought in-depth about my long-term financial goals. There were a couple resources at my university if students chose to seek them, but for the most part, I did not know much. The minute my friends working professional jobs started talking about their retirement benefits or stock options, I tuned out of the conversation. I thought to myself, "I have never had a substantial, steady income. Why should I learn about these concepts?" 

A lot of what I have to say finds its root in pfforphds.com -- Dr. Emily Roberts tells about her own journey saving up for retirement (70K during graduate school!) or other instances where PhD students have pulled off goliathan financial endeavors, such as funding a wedding.

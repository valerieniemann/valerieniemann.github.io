Why I geek out about particle accelerators.

The Buzz Around Accelerators
------
## What do alternative energy and modern medicine have in common?
### Besides being pivotal to the advancement of society, they are vast research areas using synchrotron radiation at the forefront.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I learned about synchrotron radiation when I started my undergraduate physics minor, as my professor began scribbling electrodynamics equations on the blackboard.  She described how charged particles emit electromagnetic radiation when they accelerate. At high particle rotational velocities, the resultant emission is high energy X-rays, also known as synchrotron radiation. The X-rays have similar energies of the electrons around an atom, and their wavelengths are comparable to the distance between atoms in a solid material. For this reason, she explained, we can study the chemical environment and structure of a material through the way it absorbs and scatters the X-rays. These studies occur at a synchrotron, a circular facility that accelerates  charged particles, using a large radius of particle path to achieve higher X-ray energies, therefore greater detail in which we can study new materials [1].

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unknown to me at the time, synchrotron radiation would become a key experimental component on my quest for developing materials for alternative energy applications. A few months after the physics course, I started to work at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), home to the first particle accelerator ever built. Our group used synchrotron radiation from LBNL’s synchrotron to understand the structure of novel, flexible, thermoelectric materials, for applications such as using human body heat to power medical devices [2]. More recently, I joined a team of researchers to conduct experiments at the European Synchrotron Research Facility in Grenoble, France. Using in-situ X-ray diffraction, we watched reactions involving optically-active, highly-fluorescing materials known as perovskites. These experiments helped study a way that perovskite nanocrystals, a promising yet often unstable material, could be stabilized for use in devices such as next-generation solar cells [3].

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I enjoyed conducting and learning from experiments at the synchrotron beamlines, I experienced some of the drawbacks of traditional synchrotrons. For example, they are difficult to access, with overbooked X-ray beamlines; fortunate research groups can conditionally use them once or twice a year. If the synchrotron experiments do not work, the group must wait another several months or a year to attempt them again. The synchrotrons are gargantuan, and accordingly, expensive to build and maintain. Synchrotron data acquisition is often the bottleneck to proving and publishing new discoveries. Lastly, we may have reached our traditional synchrotron size and energy limit [4,5].

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, I envision a world where high-energy X-ray characterization is accessible to greater numbers of researchers to address challenges in alternative energy, medical research, and beyond. Just as the computer started the size of a room and shrunk to 0.3 x 0.3 mm chip, I envision scaled-down particle accelerators, from the 27-mile-radius CERN to the top of a lab bench [6,7]. In recent years, a new generation of particle accelerators has emerged: laser plasma accelerators for free-electron lasers (LPA-driven FEL)[7-10]. These particle accelerators fire lasers through plasma and then eject electrons into the wake of the laser, much like a surfer riding in the wake of a boat in the ocean. The electrons accelerate in the wake, providing a ripe opportunity to acquire X-ray radiation through a linear free electron laser configuration [8]. Table-top accelerators have achieved electron energies up to 7.8 GeV, which is already higher than many current synchrotrons [7-10]. Developing this linear technique would enable laboratories to host table-top accelerators for high-quality X-ray testing.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table-top accelerator technology would answer questions that span multiple disciplines: How do genetic disorders manifest in enzyme structure [11]? What crystalline materials lead to high-performing, solar cells [12]? How can we design highly luminescent light emitting diodes (LEDs) for our screens and displays [13]? How does a chemical transformation of carbon dioxide to a usable product occur on a copper catalyst [14]? Current laboratory techniques provide clues to these questions, but table-top accelerators have the potential to answer these questions in operando, while our materials are operating. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such promise, there is still some work to do. While LPA-driven FEL have accomplished the acceleration of particles to high energies, they suffer from short laser-plasma interaction lengths. Imagine the surfer losing the pull of the boat! Other challenges include laser depletion through the plasma medium and dephasing between the plasma wave and injection electrons. The injected electrons themselves often have different energies [10-14]. Solutions to some of these challenges include staging multiple laser plasma accelerators [10].  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other solutions involve completely bypassing table-top accelerators to smaller dimensioned systems [15,16]. In fact, Stanford researchers kicked-off 2020 with a prototype “accelerator on a chip”. Their design features IR radiation laser pulses to accelerate electrons through a nanostructured silicon chip. While this design resulted in electrons with energies a fraction of those achieved in traditional particle accelerators, it served as a proof-of-concept towards accelerator miniaturization [16]. Even further, the team has set a goal to achieve electrons with 1 MeV of energy by the end of the year. This is the benchmark for use in research and medical purposes. All in all, their work demonstrates a step towards shrinking particle accelerators, which can unlock information to address climate change, genetic disorders, and beyond. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my synchrotron experiments, I have climbed upstairs to overlook the vast expanse of the facility: the particle pathway, the beamlines, and the floor bustling with international researchers, engineers, and technicians. Traditional particle accelerators represent a feat of multi-national collaboration and define “cutting-edge”. Today, they remain at the forefront of scientific discovery, yet tomorrow, we must think outside the circle.

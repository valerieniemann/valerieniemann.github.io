STEM research is hard by itself. Nature can defy our best intentions and violate our set deadlines with impunity. And yet, it gets harder. STEM research exists within a societal scaffold that biases against people of certain identities. 

In my childhood and young adult life, I was no stranger to misogynist comments from classmates, co-workers, authority, even family. I have close (even female) relatives and family friends that believe women are not fit to lead. That women
don't have minds for engineering, that it would have been better to not go to college.  

A lot of my undergraduate experience was shrouded in self-doubt, fighting those beliefs rooted deep inside of me. I think a part of me wanted to prove misogny wrong with my academic performance. I was a perfectionist, demanding flawless grades of myself. Slowly, I met
professors who I admired, and I started to think more about scientific research and the impact it can have on the world for the better. Slowly, slowly I became an opportunist. I applied to jobs, research opportunities, scholarships, etc. 
I realized that the more I applied to, the higher the chances of success. My miniscule percentage of success did in fact change my future for the better. I find myself now in a graduate program where I have supportive advisors and get to do the coolest research.

Often I want to go back to my 17-year-old self, encourage her to keep going, that her dreams can and will materialize if she keeps trying and seeking opportunities. But then I remember that for every person who said I couldn't, there was someone who said I could. 
The power of encouragement is so much greater than that of discouragement. This encouragement from professors, fellowship counselors, and researchers was enough to fuel my path. I don't need a time-machine to go back to talk to my young self. 
Instead, there is a generation of young people out there that may face gender barriers in their STEM studies. While in the past I felt unequipped to deal with gender-discrimination, the cycle does not have to continue. 

This is the power of mentorship: all those tidbits you wish you could say to your younger self, you can instead amplify and share with the upcoming generation.

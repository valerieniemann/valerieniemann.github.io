Choosing a research advisor means choosing a research group and topic simultaneously. Here we will walk through the three choices separately.

Choosing a Research Advisor
------
## *The Art of Non-fiction* by Ayn Rand 

####  While Rand may be a politically-charged figure, her writing is a pillar in both literary and philosophical canons of the 20th century. Vibrantly relevant today, her emphasis on individual rights and interests translates well to the world of STEM research.This particular work describes how the individual can "learn" the trade of non-fiction writing, much like the individual can "learn" the trade of engineering. In fact, she rejects the notion that being able to write is some innate talent, but rather eases the reader through challenges he or she might experience on the road to writing non-fiction. She gives concrete examples and exercises to emphasize the importance of structure and clarity. In the final chapter, she provides strategies to come up with ideas as a final blessing -- a small jolt of energy to get the fingers moving. 
####  Upon finishing this book, I had pages of concrete pieces of advice to compose clear, structured, non-fiction writing. Beyond this, I understood the underlying concept of "learning" a trade. It looks strinkingly similar to the pop-psych concept of having a "growth mindset." I interpret it as the way I can start with minimal knowledge in a field, then pratice, learn, and embrace fortification through failure, to grow into a writer and researcher capable of great work. This process of growth and refinement is the very reason why I decided to do a Ph.D.

        
## *Becoming* by Michelle Obama 

#### The title says it. Michelle Obama relates an intimate story of her life and background and then opens a window into life in the White House. I was surprised at how Michelle and Barack are so *relatable*, especially in the young career stages of their lives. Michelle describes how she wrestled with choosing meaningful work after earning a law degree. After reading the early years of her relationship with Barack, my partner and I found ourselves asking each other "Are you a Michelle or Barack?" Michelle describes herself as the planner and realist and Barack as the "organized chaos" and idealist. I found it curious to think of the White House as a childhood home and to connect her anecdotes with photos in news articles. Finally, the book is almost a springboard for Michelle's next steps as an advocate for gender equality and leader of the Obama Foundation. She demonstrates that in our lives, we never stop *becoming*. 


## *Komisch, Alles Chemisch!* by Mai-Thi Nguyen-Kim, Ph.D. 
         
#### "Funny, everything chemical!" is a book based on YouTuber Mai-Thi Nguyen-Kim. She takes us through a typical day through a chemistry viewpoint, describing processes in caffeine and smartphone batteries, toothpastes and delicious desserts. Along the way she discusses *fake news* popular beliefs and marketing gimics, citing scientific literature that exposes them. One example is the so-called "micellar technology" stamped on facial cleanser labels. In reality, most surfactants and soaps are micellar as defined from their chemical structure. There's no real added technology to make a cleanser, the description "micellar technology" just sounds fancy!


## *Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics* by Richard Thaler, Ph.D.

#### Why do humans deviate from rational behavior? What have classical economic models missed in their underlying assumptions? Thaler asked these questions as a Ph.D. student, and they led to the conception of *behavioral economics*. He tells the story of the birth of the field, and how it holds promise to help populations make good decisions, as related in an earlier book *Nudge*. Most noticeable to me was Thaler's persistence in the presence of dissent. He and the early behavioral economists believed in their ideas, maintaing them in the face of rejection from renowned scholars in the field. I am glad that they stuck with it. 
#### I actually made a list of cognitive biases that Thaler describes in developing some tenants of behavioral economics. I have seen them come into play in research, and I want to be able to identify them if they come to bias my decision-making and work: 
#### 1. Overconfidence - overpromising more than is possible to achieve
#### 2. Winner's curse - in auctioning, the winner overvalues the object being sold
#### 3. False consensus affect - people think that other share their preferences; they project their biases onto others
#### 4. Present bias - people tend to want instant gratification; something that one can have "now" is worth more than having it later. 
#### 5. Confirmation bias - humans want to look for confirming rather than disconfirming evidence
#### 6. Endowment effect - people want to keep what they already have rather than gain value. They are more willing to risk to avoid loss than risk to gain. 

#### One final nugget of advice that he gives to young professionals and graduate students: "When your opportunity costs are low, it pays to take risks and speak up." 

## *Playing the Game: The Streetsmart Guide to Graduate School* 
## by Fredrick Frank, Ph.D., Karl Stein Ph.D.

#### This is an old, slightly raunchy manual to getting the graduate degree. If I detached myself from some of the borderline-sexist jokes, I could focus on some of its still-relevant advice -- but let this forewarn anyone interested in reading the book. I appreciated the advice on how to keep on track to graduation amongst the distractions. Classes, politics, and your own level of self-motivation may get in the way of getting that diploma, but you can define goals to filter out the noise and work "smart." In regards to classes, it suggests that they should be taken as a means to flesh out your thesis. If there's a class that will help you do a literature review or analyze data for your research topic, then take it! It also provides a couple sections with different professor and student caricatures with suggestions with how to deal with those personality types. Funny, these things don't seem to change after a couple decades!
####  The more general statements that have stuck with me, weeks after reading the book, include:"Nobody Cares About Your Degree" and "The Longer You Stay, the Weirder You Become." In graduate school, you are master of your destiny, and you are the one that cares most about your degree. This should provide an extra impetus to define your own goals and find ways to achieve them. Even if you have the best advisor in the world, you cannot rely on them to tell you what to do. The ultimate goal is to "get the [heck] out." You are there to get the degree, which implies that you have contributed valuable knowledge to science and become an expert in your field (as measured by quality of your publications and conference presentations). This is where I am aiming. 

## *The Litte Book of Talent* by David Coyle

#### I read this in anticipation of the skills I will be learning in graduate school. It is a short read, comprising of 52 tips to learn a new skill. I'll go ahead and list a few tips that particularly spoke to me. Coyle starts out with "studying the very best" performers and mimicking them. For me, I think about this tip when I'm reading publications of researchers that I really look up to. I'll ask myself, "How can these experiments be used in my own workn?" Another tip was: "Don't fall for the prodigy myth. Early success is a weak predictor of long-term success." I think this also falls in line with the "growth mindset." Just because I might start from a different background from a person with seemingly "innate talent", I know that I can learn and grow my own talent. Finally, I liked the tip: "Pay attention immediately after you make a mistake. Take mistakes seriously but never personally." I acknowledge that I make many mistakes on a daily basis, but studying them and learning from them is key to correcting them. As you can see, this is a highly practical and immediately-employable work!

## *Atlas Shrugged* by Ayn Rand

#### I should note at this point why Rand pops up on my reading list twice; there is a website, freeobjectivistbooks.org, that will send free books to students. Nothing comes truly for free, so I would encourage critical thinking when reading these books or any others. 
#### That being said, I do agree with Ayn Rand that this is her masterpiece. She heralds the creativity and striving of the individual mind, and she depicts what the world would look like if great minds went on strike. Politics aside, the characters Dagny Taggart, Henry Rearden, and John Galt, strangely show many characteristics of a successful grad student or even start-up founder: extreme dedication to the task, persistence in the face of all obstacles, and integration of the mind and body as one being. Another concept that stood out to me was the ability to do tasks quickly and efficiently for the enjoyment of life. 
#### Perhaps my favorite scene is when Dagny Taggart pilots a plane to chase down renegade John Galt, the brilliant inventor of a motor running on atmospheric static electricity (okay, we will let go of scientific rigor for a second). Talk about dedication to scientific progress. 

## Research topic
### 1. You want a research topic that interests you. Okay, work becomes work, and by year three, no matter what you choose, it might start to get stale. Everyone experiences this a bit differently. But the initial excitement about the topic sparks the motivation to learn the field and get experiments underway, so make sure you *love* your initial topic and project. These should interest you by:
- **Addressing a bigger problem or fundamental question that excites you.** What motivates you to be a scientist? What have you been curious about? You can choose a problem to solve or you can investigate a phenomenon (the classic applied/fundamental divide). Most research topics can include both types of studies. 
- **Involving compatible day-to-day responsibilities.** If you want to cure cancer but get squeamish at the sight of blood, your research career might not pan out. I typically ask group members what the "most annoying" part of their work is. For making colloidal nanocrystal, it's the irreproducibility of the synthesis after years of working on it. For 2D material scientists, it's maintaing a firm grasp of really thin flakes with tweezers. For computational and theoretical folks, it's sitting down at a computer all day. Know the types of work you will have to do on a daily basis, and make sure it is tolerable to you. 
- **Capturing your focus when reading literature.** I have found that I can understand most literature in materials science, but some topics just do not interest me. I can tell by how my attention wanders. The literature that interests me, on the other hand, has me furiously scribbling notes and looking up terms that I do not understand. You need to be able to read literature in your field for inspiration, ideas, and growth of expertise. 

### 2. You want a research topic that will translate to a job. The topic has a higher chance of leading to a job if you find: 
- **Companies, post-docs, or fellowship opportunities that logically follow.** It is never too early to consider what you want to do for a career. 
- **A larger community around the topic** Who are the experts in the field, your role-models, whose work you like to read and propagate? Is it possible to visit their group? Will they speak at your university or attend the same conference as you? Learn from these role-models. Did the students who came before you get jobs? Your discipline community can provide a direction to employment after you get your Ph.D.

### 3. Questions to consider:
- What problem do you want to solve?
- Which area of fundamental science interests you?
- Where do you want to be in five years?

###  Decision made? If yes, then congrats! If not, then keep gathering information for as long as your program allows. Once the deadline comes and you make the decision, you can forget about those other options for advisors/groups/topics. Now is the time to forge ahead, learn from your mistakes, and make the best of every situation, knowing that you did the legwork to set-up your future career.

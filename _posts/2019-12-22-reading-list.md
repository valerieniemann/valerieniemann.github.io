Here's a snapshot of some of the books that passed through my read queue this year.

My 2019 Book List
------
## *The Art of Non-fiction* by Ayn Rand 

####  While Rand may be a politically-charged figure, her writing is a pillar in the literature and philosophical canon of the 20th century. Vibrantly relevant today, her emphasis on individual rights and interests translates well to the world of STEM research.This particular work describes how the individual can "learn" the trade of non-fiction writing, much like the individual can "learn" the trade of engineering. In fact, she rejects the notion that being able to write is some innate talent, but rather eases the reader through challenges he or she might experience on the road to writing non-fiction. She gives concrete examples and exercises to emphasize the importance of structure and clarity. In the final chapter, she provides strategies to come up with ideas as a final blessing -- a small jolt of energy to get the fingers moving. 
####  Upon finishing this book, I had pages of concrete pieces of advice to compose clear, structured, non-fiction writing. Beyond this, I understood the underlying concept of "learning" a trade. It looks strinkingly similar to the pop-psych concept of having a "growth mindset." I interpret it as starting from very little, practicing and learning, embracing fortification through failure, to grow into a writer and researcher capable of great work. This process of growth and refinement is the veryreason why I decided to do a Ph.D.

        
## *Becoming* by Michelle Obama 

#### The title says it. Michelle Obama relates an intimate story of her life and background and then gives us a window-look into life in the White House. I was surprised at how Michelle and Barack are so *relatable*, especially in the young career stage oftheir lives. Michelle expands about how to do meaningful work after earning a law degree. When she talks about early years of her relationship with Barack, my partner and I found ourselves asking each other "Are you a Michelle or Barack?" Michelle, the planner and realist, Barack, the "organized chaos" and idealist. I found it curious to think of the White House home, and to connect her anectdotes with photos in news articles. Finally, the book is almost a springboard for Michelle's next steps as an advocate for gender equality and leader of the Obama Foundation. In our lives, we never stop *becoming*. 


## *Komisch, Alles Chemisch!* by Mai-Thi Nguyen-Kim, Ph.D. 
         
#### "Funny, everything chemical!" is a book based on a youtube channeler Mai-Thi Nguyen-Kim. She takes us through a typical day with all the chemistry that impacts us on a daily basis, from caffeine to smartphone batteries, toothpase to a delicious dessert. Along the way she discusses *fake news* popular beliefs and marketing gimics, citing scientific literature that exposes them. One example is the so-called "micellar technology" stamped on facial cleanser labels. In reality, most surfactants and soaps are micellar as defined from their chemical structure. There's no added technology; including, it just sounds fancy! 


## *Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics* by Richard Thaler, Ph.D.

#### Why do humans deviate from rational behavior? What have classical economic models missed in their underlying assumptions? Thaler asked these questions as a Ph.D. student, and they led to the conception of *behavioral economics*. He tells the story of the birth of the field, and how it holds promise to help populations make good decisions, as related in an earlier book *Nudge*. Most noticeable to me was Thaler's persistence in the presence of dissent. He and the early behavioral economists believed in their ideas and had to defend in the face of rejection from renowned scholars in the field. I am glad that they stuck with it. 

## *Playing the Game: The Streetsmart Guide to Graduate School* by Fredrick Frank, Ph.D., Karl Stein Ph.D.

## *The Litte Book of Talent* by David Coyle

## *Atlas Shrugged* by Ayn Rand

## *Shantaram* by Gregory David Roberts

Here's a snapshot of some of the books that passed through my read queue this year.

My 2019 Book List
------
*The Art of Non-fiction* by Ayn Rand 

            While Rand may be a politically-charged figure, her writing has left its mark on the literature and philosophical canon of the 
          20th century. Vibrantly relevant today, her emphasis on individual rights and interests translates well to the world of STEM 
          research.This particular work describes how the individual can "learn" the trade of non-fiction writing, much like the 
          individual can "learn" the trade of engineering. In fact, she rejects the notion that being able to write is some innate 
          talent, but rather eases the reader through challenges he or she might experience on the road to writing non-fiction. 
          She gives concrete examples and exercises to emphasize the importance of structure and clarity. In the final chapter, she 
          provides strategies to come up with ideas as a final blessing -- a small jolt of energy to get the fingers moving. 
            Upon finishing this book, I had pages of concrete pieces of advice to compose clear, structured, non-fiction writing. Beyond 
          this, I understood the underlying concept of "learning" a trade. It looks strinkingly similar to the pop-psych concept of 
          having a "growth mindset." I interpret it as starting from very little, practicing and learning, embracing fortification 
          through failure, to grow into a writer and researcher capable of great work. This is why I decided to do a Ph.D.

Here's a snapshot of some of the books that passed through my read queue this year.

My 2019 Book List
------
## *The Art of Non-fiction* by Ayn Rand 

####  While Rand may be a politically-charged figure, her writing is a pillar in the literature and philosophical canon of the 20th century. Vibrantly relevant today, her emphasis on individual rights and interests translates well to the world of STEM research.This particular work describes how the individual can "learn" the trade of non-fiction writing, much like the individual can "learn" the trade of engineering. In fact, she rejects the notion that being able to write is some innate talent, but rather eases the reader through challenges he or she might experience on the road to writing non-fiction. She gives concrete examples and exercises to emphasize the importance of structure and clarity. In the final chapter, she provides strategies to come up with ideas as a final blessing -- a small jolt of energy to get the fingers moving. 
####  Upon finishing this book, I had pages of concrete pieces of advice to compose clear, structured, non-fiction writing. Beyond this, I understood the underlying concept of "learning" a trade. It looks strinkingly similar to the pop-psych concept of having a "growth mindset." I interpret it as the way I can start with minimal knowledge in a field, then pratice, learn, and embrace fortification through failure, to grow into a writer and researcher capable of great work. This process of growth and refinement is the very reason why I decided to do a Ph.D.

        
## *Becoming* by Michelle Obama 

#### The title says it. Michelle Obama relates an intimate story of her life and background and then gives us a window into life in the White House. I was surprised at how Michelle and Barack are so *relatable*, especially in the young career stages of their lives. Michelle expands about how to do meaningful work after earning a law degree. When she talks about early years of her relationship with Barack, my partner and I found ourselves asking each other "Are you a Michelle or Barack?" Michelle, the planner and realist, Barack, the "organized chaos" and idealist. I found it curious to think of the White House as a childhood home and to connect her anecdotes with photos in news articles. Finally, the book is almost a springboard for Michelle's next steps as an advocate for gender equality and leader of the Obama Foundation. In our lives, we never stop *becoming*. 


## *Komisch, Alles Chemisch!* by Mai-Thi Nguyen-Kim, Ph.D. 
         
#### "Funny, everything chemical!" is a book based on a YouTube channeler Mai-Thi Nguyen-Kim. She takes us through a typical day with daily chemistry, from caffeine to smartphone batteries, toothpase to a delicious dessert. Along the way she discusses *fake news* popular beliefs and marketing gimics, citing scientific literature that exposes them. One example is the so-called "micellar technology" stamped on facial cleanser labels. In reality, most surfactants and soaps are micellar as defined from their chemical structure. There's no added technology; including, it just sounds fancy! 


## *Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics* by Richard Thaler, Ph.D.

#### Why do humans deviate from rational behavior? What have classical economic models missed in their underlying assumptions? Thaler asked these questions as a Ph.D. student, and they led to the conception of *behavioral economics*. He tells the story of the birth of the field, and how it holds promise to help populations make good decisions, as related in an earlier book *Nudge*. Most noticeable to me was Thaler's persistence in the presence of dissent. He and the early behavioral economists believed in their ideas and had to defend in the face of rejection from renowned scholars in the field. I am glad that they stuck with it. 

## *Playing the Game: The Streetsmart Guide to Graduate School* by Fredrick Frank, Ph.D., Karl Stein Ph.D.

#### This is an old, slightly raunchy manual to getting the graduate degree. If I detached myself from some of the borderline-sexist jokes, I could focus on some good advice that it provided -- but let this forewarn anyone interested in reading the book. I appreciated the advice on how to keep on track amongst the distractions. Classes, politics, and your own level of self-motivation may get in the way of getting that diploma, but you can define goals to filter out the noise and work "smart." In regards to classes, it suggests that they should be taken as a means to flesh out your thesis. If there's a class that will help you do a literature review or analyze data for your research topic, then take it! It also provides an invaluable section with different professor and student caricatures, and some suggestions with how to deal with those personality types. 
####  The more general statements that have stuck with me, weeks after reading the book, include:"Nobody Cares About Your Degree" and "The Longer You Stay, the Weirder You Become." In graduate school, you are master of your destiny, and you are the one that cares most about your degree. This should provide an extra impetus to define your own goals and find ways to achieve them. The ultimate goal is to "get the [heck] out." You are there to get the degree, which implies that you have contributed valuable knowledge to science and become an expert in your field (as measured by quality of your publications and conference presentations). This is where I am aiming. 

## *The Litte Book of Talent* by David Coyle

## *Atlas Shrugged* by Ayn Rand

#### I should note at this point why Rand pops up on my reading list twice; there is a website, freeobjectivistbooks.org, that will send free books to students. Nothing comes truly for free, so I would encourage critical thinking when reading these books or any others. 
#### That being said, I do agree with Ayn Rand that this is her masterpiece. She heralds the creativity and striving of the individual mind, and she depicts what the world would look like if great minds went on strike. Politics aside, the characters Dagny Taggart, Henry Rearden, and John Galt, strangely show many characteristics of a successful grad student or even start-up founder: extreme dedication to the task, persistence in the face of all obstacles, and even integration of the mind and body as one being. Another concept that stood out to me was the ability to do tasks quickly and efficiently for the enjoyment of life. 
#### Perhaps my favorite scene is when Dagny Taggart pilots a plane to chase down renegade John Galt, the brilliant inventor of a motor running on atmospheric static electricity(okay, we will let go of scientific rigor for a second). Talk about dedication to scientific progress. 

## *Shantaram* by Gregory David Roberts 

#### *Based on a true story* -- I am ever-so-curious to find out to what extent. This reads like an action novel, but it is based on the life events of author Gregory David Roberts. Apparently I am not alone. Many have posed the question to Roberts, with the response: "Some experiences from my life are described pretty much as they happened, and others are created narratives, informed by my experience. I wanted to write two or three novels on some bare elements from my life, allowing me to explore the themes that interested me, while keeping the narrative immediate by anchoring it to some of my real experiences. They’re novels, not autobiographies, and all of the characters and dialogue is created. It doesn’t matter how much of it is true or not to me, it’s how true they are to all of us, and to our common humanity." 
#### We do know that he was a heroin addict, a bank-robber, and an inmate in an Australian jail. He broke out

collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-09-25-understanding-metal-induced-degradation
excerpt: 'A deeper understanding of the perovskite–metal chemistry is crucial to elucidate the instability problems at the device level that can be caused by such interactions. Here, we study the reactions occurring between CsPbX3 (X = Br, BrI, I) perovskite and metal (M = Ag, Cu, Au) nanocrystals. We demonstrate a fast (less than 1 hour) optical and structural degradation of the I-containing nanocrystals driven by the formation of metal iodides with reaction kinetics according to the following order: Cu less than Ag less than Au. These results point to the need for thoughtful considerations while constructing optoelectronic devices out of all-inorganic CsPbX3 nanocrystals, where the use of contact metals is a necessity.'

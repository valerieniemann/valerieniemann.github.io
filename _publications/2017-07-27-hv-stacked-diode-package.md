title: "High voltage stacked diode package with integrated thermal management"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-07-27-hv-stacked-diode-package
excerpt: 'Recent fabrication of high voltage (15-30 kV) single-die silicon carbide (SiC) power devices have necessitated advanced packaging methods to realize their full potential. This work discusses the limits of current power electronics packaging and explores an option of stacking high voltage Junction Barrier Schottky (JBS) diodes with integrated cooling. The new package has been designed, fabricated, and tested showing it can handle continuous and pulsed loads up to 21 kV. Dielectric fluid tests and pulsed measurements were also performed. Co-design and co-engineering methodologies were implemented during the initial design process. A key component to the co-designed module is a multi-functional connector (MFC) which acts as a mechanical, thermal and electrical contact at the same time. Adding enhanced functionality to package parts can potentially allow significant improvement in size, weight, cost, reliability, and performance.'

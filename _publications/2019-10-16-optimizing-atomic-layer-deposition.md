excerpt: 'Encapsulation methods have been shown to be effective in imparting improved stability to metal-halide perovskite nanocrystals. Here, we optimize the atomic layer deposition of amorphous alumina as a protective layer for CsPbBr3 quantum dot thin films. We use oxygen as a molecular diffusion probe to assess the uniformity of the deposited alumina layer.'

Encapsulation methods have been shown to be effective in imparting improved stability to metal-halide perovskite nanocrystals. Here, we optimize the atomic layer deposition of amorphous alumina as a protective layer for CsPbBr3 quantum dot thin films. We use oxygen as a molecular diffusion probe to assess the uniformity of the deposited alumina layer.
This paper is about the number 1. The number 2 is left for future work.
